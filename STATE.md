# State — Casual Roguelike Autobattler

## What this is

A **casual mobile roguelike autobattler**, single-player PvE (hypothesis, not settled).

- Team: 2 people (+ a friend contributing) + AI. Platform: mobile, casual audience.
- Prototype #1 is a vehicle for judging the lead moment, not the real game.

## What we're betting on

> **"I assemble my squad, press play, and watch it pay off far bigger than I expected — a cascade I set in motion but couldn't fully predict, that looked like it might fail first, and that I can still claim as mine."**

- **Watch-native** — a run opens on a fight, and every screen but the relic pick is accept-default.
- **Unpredictable** — chain length is the loudest dice; per-hit variance, backfire, and the encounter draw are the rest.
- **Losable** — a run can genuinely be lost, and a backfire can create a losing position outright.
- **Attributable** — the round screen names each role's chain and the enemy before the player picks who fights.

## Where it stands

A run grows over 20 rounds through a relic (round 1's reward), reward cards, role upgrades and duo cards; cards are "when X, do Y" rules that can set each other off. Fatigue and Recruit are tuned to give a worn unit ways out (bench, Rest, Recruit), batch-verified and not yet played. Two runs have been played by hand from the new opening, and every screen has an `export` link that writes the run to a file. The work now is making every mark card fire in an ordinary run and rechecking why the Exposed build wins less than Burn or Frozen; the shield segment on the HP bar is built but not yet seen in a browser.

## Next up

1. **Fix the cards that rarely fire:** Glass fires only when a freeze ends; Overflow, Ember heart, Cold snap, Bulwark and Deep freeze fire in under half their held fights (the "rarely fires" line of `npm run batch -- --offers build`).
2. **Rebalance outliers** from the synergy block: Punish is the weakest card by a wide margin, and recheck whether Exposed's cards still trail Burn's.
3. **Play more runs** (`npm run dev`), a different build each time, and send the `export` file — a build verdict is checked against it, and so is whether fatigue and Recruit now feel survivable, whether you bench tired heroes by hand now the squad stays put, and the coloured mark words read clearly.
4. **Pick a target for chains' share of damage** — it is about 44% of player damage now.
5. Fix the healer-only stalemate and the two recap wording bugs ("for 0" on a guard/stun save; the guard's repeated "against" line).

## Unverified bets

- Chains every fight still feel unpredictable, rather than averaging out into a steady trade.
- Push or rest stays a real choice: batch shows a frayed chain out-hitting a worn one only slightly, and fielded fatigue falls to ~13 by round 20.
- Players bench a tired hero by hand: the batch bot rotates its squad, but the pick screen now keeps last round's.
- Cards and duos give a combo worth chasing next run — the bet this whole pass exists for.
- A relic picked after one fight gives the run an identity, not just one more upgrade.
- A cascade stays readable on a phone screen.

## Open questions

- Does the Exposed build still win less than Burn or Frozen, and is that its cards or a multiplier on a flat damage number? Gates Next up #2.
- What fire rate is healthy for a card that fires only on a moment (Lay bare, Second wind)? Gates Next up #1.
- Do today's relics set a run's identity, or do some need to be bigger rule changes? Answered by Next up #3.
- Do eased fatigue and common Recruit feel survivable by hand? Answered by Next up #3.
- What share of a fight's outcome should chains decide? Gates Next up #4.

## How to work here

- Read order: this file → [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the game's shape (stale on the core
  loop) → [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) **by grep only**, never top-to-bottom.
- `DECISIONS.md` has an archive rule; entries below it predate the 2026-07-18 pivot.
- Decisions are proposed, never silently logged — on a confirmed yes, append via the `decision-log` skill.
- This file is regenerated only when asked, via the `state-sync` skill; `REFERENCE.md` is not.
- Commands: `npm run dev` to play (the corner `export` link saves the run as JSON; `?test=1&seed=N` runs the `archive/ATTRIBUTION_TEST.md` protocol),
  `npm run check` for regressions, `npm run batch -- --n 1000 --offers build` (add `--set key=number,...` to sweep a value, `--cards a,b` to restrict the pool) — full list in `prototype/COMMANDS.md`.
- Code: `prototype/src/sim/` (`config.ts` holds every tunable, `rounds.ts` the round plan, `cards/` the card engine and definitions), `src/render/`, `src/batch/`, `src/checks/`, `src/log/` (the export).
